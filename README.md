# Image Classification Projects Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of **image classification** projects that I have developed to explore various aspects of predictive modeling in computer vision. Each project demonstrates different classification techniques, methodologies, and datasets, showcasing my skills in data analysis and machine learning.

## Purpose
The primary intention of this repository is to:
- Provide a comprehensive understanding of image classification techniques.
- Highlight the application of various models in solving real-world image recognition problems.
- Share insights and methodologies that can be beneficial for learning and reference.

## Projects Included

### Project 1: [Leaf Classification]
**Description**: Developed a custom CNN with functional API to classify leaves.


### Project 2: [Playing Card Classifier]
**Description**: Created a model to classify 52 playing cards. Leveraged Transfer Learning capabilities.


## Conclusion
Through these projects, I aim to deepen my understanding of image classification and its applications in predictive modeling. I hope this repository serves as a useful resource for anyone interested in learning more about image classification techniques and their practical applications.
